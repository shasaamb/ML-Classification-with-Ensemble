# 🏭 Predictive Maintenance with Ensemble Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **predictive maintenance** using **ensemble learning techniques** to classify machine failures in industrial settings. By leveraging **Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Classifier**, the model helps identify **potential failures, anomalies, and maintenance needs** before they lead to critical breakdowns.

## 🎯 Project Summary

### 🔍 Objective
- Develop a **classification model** to detect early signs of machine failure.
- Improve predictive maintenance using **ensemble methods**.

### 📊 Dataset: MetroPT-3
- **15 attributes** covering machine performance metrics.
- **15,169,480 instances**—a real-world high-volume dataset.
- No missing values, enabling direct feature analysis.

### ⚙️ Methods & Techniques
- **Data Preprocessing:** Feature selection, data cleaning, and handling class imbalances.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding feature distributions and correlations.
- **Baseline Model:** Establishing classification benchmarks.
- **Final Models:**
  - **Random Forest Classifier** – A bagging-based model for robust classification.
  - **Gradient Boosting Classifier** – A boosting-based method optimizing prediction accuracy.

### 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score** to measure classification effectiveness.
- **Feature Importance Analysis** to interpret model decision-making.

### 🔬 Results & Findings
- **Random Forest** provided a stable and generalizable classification model.
- **Gradient Boosting** improved precision on rare failure cases.
- **Both models successfully identified potential failures**, reducing unplanned downtime.
